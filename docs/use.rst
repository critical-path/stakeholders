Add stakeholders
----------------

In the navbar, select :code:`stakeholders` and then :code:`add`.

Use the form to identify and evaluate a stakeholder.  Enter the stakeholder's name, role, sentiment toward your project, level of power, and level of interest in your project.  Then click on the :code:`add` button.

Repeat this process as many times as necessary.

Show stakeholders
-----------------

In the navbar, select :code:`stakeholders` and then :code:`show/update/delete`.

Your stakeholders appear here, sorted by their unique identifiers.  Each stakeholder has a management approach, which is a function of that stakeholder's levels of power and interest.

Add deliverables
----------------

In the navbar, select :code:`deliverables` and then :code:`add`.

Use the form to identify a deliverable, where a deliverable is a reporting requirement.  Enter the deliverable's name, kind (type), medium, level of formality, and frequency.  Then click on the :code:`add` button.

Repeat this process as many times as necessary.

Show deliverables
-----------------

In the navbar, select :code:`deliverables` and then :code:`show/update/delete`.

Your deliverables appear here, sorted by their unique identifiers.

Add associations
----------------

In the navbar, select :code:`associations` and then :code:`add`.

Use the form to identify an association, where an association is the assignment of a deliverable to a stakeholder.  Enter a stakeholder and a deliverable appropriate for that stakeholder.  Then click on the :code:`add` button.

Repeat this process as many times as necessary.  (It is possible to assign multiple deliverables to the same stakeholder as well as to assign the same deliverable to multiple stakeholders.)

Show associations
-----------------

In the navbar, select :code:`associations` and then :code:`show/update/delete`.

Your associations appear here, sorted by their unique identifiers.

View management plan
--------------------

In the navbar, select :code:`management-plan`.

Your associations appear here, sorted first by management approach, then by stakeholders' unique identifiers, and then by deliverables' unique identifiers.

This is your stakeholder management - the whole purpose of this app! 

Make updates
------------

In the navbar, select either :code:`stakeholders`, :code:`deliverables`, or :code:`associations` and then :code:`show/update/delete`.

Find a stakeholder, deliverable, or association and then click on its :code:`update` or :code:`delete` button.
